				<i>More { fmt.Sprintf("{ }") } Please</i> is a collection of topics designed to be a simple, readable resource for learning technology by example.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each topic focuses on a particular programming language or technology domain. I think the best way to learn is by doing. Each topic contains hundreds of code examples that are editable and runnable in your browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				I created <i>More { fmt.Sprintf("{ }") } Please</i> as a way to refresh my deep learning skills by researching and creating these examples by hand. The material also tries to bring attention to (sometimes opinionated) best practices if you are brand new to a topic.
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal is to promote learning in a thoughtful, peaceful, distraction-free way. That's why there are no ads and a lot of whitespace. If you have suggestions or find any errors please reach out to me at
