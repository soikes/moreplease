                    The <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY")</span> clause allows you to sort the results of a query based on a particular column.<br><br>
                    Rows have no defined sort order in most databases by default. If no <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY")</span> clause is specified, rows are returned based on speed and efficiency and should not be relied on to return rows in the same order every time.<br><br>
                    To sort rows in ascending order use <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY ... ASC")</span> and to sort in descending order use <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY ... DESC")</span>.<br><br>
                    The method by which a column is sorted depends on the data type of the column. By default in most database engines <span>@st.Inline("ASC")</span> will sort <span>@st.Inline("INTEGER")</span> types numerically from lowest to highest, <span>@st.Inline("TEXT")</span> types alphabetically, and <span>@st.Inline("DATE")</span> and similar types chronologically from oldest to newest. Refer to the particular database engine you use to see how other types are sorted.<br><br>
                    It is best practice to <i>always</i> be explicit and include an <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY")</span> in your queries. For brevity, the rest of the examples on this website will not include <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY")</span> unless it's relevant to the example.
                </div>
                @e.Run("sql/order_by.sql")
                <div>
                    <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY")</span> can be applied to multiple columns which applies the sorting in that order when a column has duplicate values.
                </div>
                @e.Run("sql/order_by_multicolumn.sql")
                <div>
                    <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY")</span> is applied after other clauses like <span>@st.Inline("WHERE")</span> but there are some clauses that are applied after it such as <a href="/limit"><span>@st.Inline("LIMIT")</span></a>.
                </div>
                @e.Run("sql/order_by_where.sql")
                <div>
                    <span>@st.Inline("NULL")</span> values are sorted differently depending on the database engine used. SQLite treats <span>@st.Inline("NULL")</span> as "smaller" than non-<span>@st.Inline("NULL")</span> values, meaning they will appear first if you <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY ... ASC")</span>.<br><br>
                    Some database engines, including SQLite, support <span>@st.Inline("ASC NULLS LAST")</span> or <span>@st.Inline("DESC NULLS FIRST")</span> clauses which alter the default ordering of <span>@st.Inline("NULL")</span> in the results.
                </div>
                @e.Run("sql/order_by_null.sql")
                <div class="linkable" id="collation">
                    Capitalized letters, special characters, whitespace and numbers inside strings have a particular sort order depending on the database engine. Be sure to find out the default ordering and comparison rules, or "collation", for the database you are using.<br><br>
                    The default collation for text in SQLite is called <span>@st.Inline("BINARY")</span> which means text characters are compared based on their binary (ASCII/Unicode) representation.
                    See 
                    @st.Outlink("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Character_order", "ASCII Character Order")
                    .<br><br>
                    This is why "james" appears at the bottom of the <span>@st.Inline("ASC")</span> ordered query.
                </div>
                @e.Run("sql/order_by_special_characters.sql")
                <div>
                    The <span>@st.Inline("COLLATE")</span> operator can be used to alter the collation rules for the current statement. SQLite includes three collation sequences:<br><br>
                    <span>@st.Inline("RTRIM")</span>: Ignores trailing whitespace.<br><br>
                    <span>@st.Inline("NOCASE")</span>: Ignores case.<br><br>
                    <span>@st.Inline("BINARY")</span>: Compare text characters based on their binary (ASCII/Unicode) representation.<br><br>
                    SQLite itself can be compiled with extensions such as language-specific collations. Other database engines like MySQL or PostgreSQL offer more built-in collations.
                </div>

                    Computations can be applied to an <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY")</span>. This example shows a query that orders the table based on the total length of a user's first and last name.<br><br>
                    <span>@st.Inline("length")</span> is an unrelated <a href="/functions">function</a> that is included to demonstrate the example.
                </div>
                @e.Run("sql/order_by_computation_direct.sql")
                <div>
                    If we want to show the result of the computation and still order by it, <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY")</span> will accept an alias created earlier in the statement.<br><br>
                    Applying computations to <span>@st.Inline("ORDER BY")</span> can be used in clever ways to sort data that would not be possible with the data itself.
                </div>
                @e.Run("sql/order_by_computation.sql")
