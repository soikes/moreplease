				<p>
					The 
					<span>
						@t.Link(site.MSP.Page(site.FunctionsPage), "")
					</span> topic introduces the concept of simple/scalar functions, which accept zero or more input values and produce a single output value per row.				
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Aggregate functions</i> are categorized differently because they operate on more than one row of data at a time.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						@t.Inline("count()")
					</span> is a function that accepts a column name or a 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("*")
					</span> as input. Instead of returning data though, it returns a count of the total number of rows.  If a 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("*")
					</span> is specified, the count of all rows in the table is returned. Think of it as asking for a row count "including all columns".
				</p>
			</div>
			@e.Run("sql/count.sql")
			<div>
				<p>
					If a column name is specified, the returned count is the number of non-
					<span>
						@t.Inline("NULL")
					</span> rows.
				</p>
			</div>
			@e.Run("sql/count_column.sql")
			<div>
				<p>
					Aggregate functions can accept a 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("DISTINCT")
					</span> clause which causes duplicate rows to be ignored by the function. Here, the second "Amini" last name is not included in the count.
				</p>
			</div>
			@e.Run("sql/count_distinct.sql")
			<div>
				<p>
					Another commonly used aggregate function is 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("max()")
					</span>. It accepts a single column name and returns the maximum value out of all of the rows. The maximum value is determined in the same way as an 
					@t.LinkWithText(site.MSP.Page(site.OrderByPage), "") {
						@t.Inline("ORDER BY")
					}
					: by following the current 
					<span>
						@t.LinkWithText(site.MSP.Page(site.OrderByPage), "collation") {
							collation
						}
					</span> for that data type.
				</p>
				<p>
					To instead find the minimum value, the 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("min()")
					</span> function is used.
				</p>
				<p>
					Keep in mind that in SQLite and other databases, 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("max()")
					</span> and 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("min()")
					</span> have versions that accept multiple arguments which are actually scalar functions that perform a different task.
				</p>
			</div>
			@e.Run("sql/max.sql")
			<div>
				<p>
					The 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("sum()")
					</span> function calculates the sum of all non-
					<span>
						@t.Inline("NULL")
					</span> values. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If every input row is 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("NULL")
					</span> then 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("sum()")
					</span> will return 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("NULL")
					</span>. Unfortunately this is required by the SQL standard and several aggregate functions behave this way. This is not very useful if you are expecting a numerical result so some databases like SQLite have implemented a nonstandard 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("total()")
					</span> function that returns 0.0 in this case instead.
				</p>
			</div>
			@e.Run("sql/sum.sql")
			<div>
				<p>
					The 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("avg()")
					</span> function calculates an average value across all the rows. It is equivalent to running 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("total() / count()")
					</span>. Note again that only non-
					<span>
						@t.Inline("NULL")
					</span> values are considered in the calculation.
				</p>
				<p>
					In SQLite string values that can't be converted into numbers, such as 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("\"hello\"")
					</span>, are treated as 
					<span>
						@t.Inline("0")
					</span> in the average calculation.
				</p>
			</div>
			@e.Run("sql/avg.sql")
			<div>
				<p>
					There are often more built-in aggregate functions to use as well as the ability to define your own aggregate functions similar to scalar functions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aggregate functions are powerful tools alone but they become even more useful when combined with the 
					<span>
						@t.LinkWithText(site.MSP.Page(site.GroupByPage), "") {
							<span>
								@t.Inline("GROUP BY")
							</span>
						}
					</span> clause which we will explore next.
